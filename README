This is the Python reimplementation of the MSM code, which was developped in the ESHIEM project funded by ESA.

https://spitfire.estec.esa.int/trac/ESHIEM/browser/msm

However, access to MSM is restricted to ESA at the momemt. Meanwhile you can learn about all the algorithms and implementation from this techinical note of the project:

https://github.com/drflei/PyMSM/files/10304134/TN2a.v1.5.pdf

There are serveral branches/versions of the python implementation. Please use the version in the irbem or spacepy branches for now. 

Implementaion in the other branches are still incomplete ...

Note: the MAPS is a softlink and it should lead to another repository. If not working they are available here: https://github.com/drflei/MSM_maps
