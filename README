To compile/build:

 	$ make -f msm.mak

To run:

Before your first run, you have to un-tar the maps_xxxxx.tz file to have the MAPS ready, e.g.

	$ tar xfz maps_20140319.tz  

There are two ways to supply the inputs needed for the execution: 

1) Via the namelist file "msm.nml". The user has to update this file before
execution. To use the namelist option, simply run msm without any argument at
the command line, i.e. 
   	$ ./msm

2) inputs on the command line:

   	$ ./msm orbit-file kp output-file directory-name-of-the-maps (optial: a_err b_err)

The directory-name-of-the-maps is where the pre-calculated maps are,
e.g. the root of the "MAPS" path. 

The a_err b_err are optional arguments for user specified parameters for calculating the 
transmission function errors. If not suppled, the defaults a_err=5., b=0.1, i.e. 5% and 0.1 GV,
will be used.
