      G.08 -  How is defined a drift shell ?
</ul> <h2> <a name="answer"> Answer </a> </h2> <ul>
<i>
A text extracted from Lemaire et al. (1995, p. 48-51) is reproduced
below.  The text summarizes the definitions of the different 
geomagnetic coordinates and clearly explains the concept of
magnetic drift shell. The text is part of the TREND-2 final
report.

<p>

McIlwain's (1961) <i>L</i>-parameter is defined in terms of the 
integral <i>I</i>:
<center>
<img src="faq08a.gif">
</center>
where <i>A</i> and <i>A</i>' represent the locations of two magnetically 
conjugate
points, and <i>B</i> and d<i>s</i> are the magnetic field intensity and the
line element
along the field line. <i>A</i> corresponds to the point for which the value of 
<i>L</i>
is sought. <i>B</i><sub>m</sub> is the magnetic field intensity at the points 
<i>A</i> and <i>A</i>'. Due
to the conservation of the first adiabatic invariant <i>mu</i> and of the 
particle
energy <i>E</i>, <i>B</i><sub>m</sub> is an adiabatic invariant of motion for
all particles
mirroring at <i>A</i> and <i>A</i>'. Due to the conservation of the second 
invariant of
motion <i>J</i>, <i>I</i> also is an adiabatic invariant for all particles
mirroring at
<i>A</i> and <i>A</i>'.

<p>

These properties have led to the introduction of the 
(<i>B</i><sub>m</sub>,<i>I</i>) coordinates to
map perpendicular integral fluxes <i>J</i> and differential fluxes <i>j</i>
of energetic
particles mirroring at <i>A</i>, i.e. with velocities perpendicular to the 
magnetic
field vector <b>B</b> and thus with pitch angles 
<i>alpha</i> = 90<sup>o</sup>. The coordinate
pair (<i>B</i><sub>m</sub>,<i>I</i>) uniquely defines the drift shell of all 
particles mirroring at
<i>A</i>. A drift shell is the surface formed by the segments of the magnetic
field lines bounded by the intersections of the surfaces 
<i>B</i> = <i>B</i><sub>m</sub> and <i>I</i> = cst. It
is important to realise that drift shells do not correspond to magnetic shells
which are surfaces formed by the magnetic field lines with 
<i>B</i><sub>eq</sub> = cst
(<i>B</i><sub>eq</sub> is the magnetic field intensity on the magnetic 
equator) 
and
extend down to the surface of the Earth (see Figure 1 below).

<p>

In a pure dipole magnetic field, the magnetic field distribution is
axisymmetric with respect to the magnetic axis, and thus drift shells are
axisymmetric as well. On the basis of this property, McIlwain (1961) found it
more convenient and appealing to introduce a more geometrically meaningful
parameter <i>L</i><sub>m</sub>, which corresponds to the equatorial radius 
of a drift shell in
the case of a dipole field. McIlwain extended this definition to non-dipole
field distributions, such as the geomagnetic field, by applying the functional
relation between <i>L</i><sub>m</sub>, <i>B</i><sub>m</sub>, 
and <i>I</i>, derived for a dipole field, to non-dipole
field distributions. <i>L</i><sub>m</sub> is unambiguously determined 
for each point on a
closed magnetic field line, using (<i>B</i><sub>m</sub>,<i>I</i>) 
computed with a model magnetic
field distribution (including external field models). Consequently, the
coordinate pair (<i>B</i><sub>m</sub>,<i>L</i><sub>m</sub>) is equivalent 
to the coordinate pair (<i>B</i><sub>m</sub>,<i>I</i>).
Usually, the index ``m'' is dropped and the McIlwain coordinates are denoted by
(<i>B</i>,<i>L</i>).

<p>

For particles with pitch angles <i>alpha</i> not equal to 90<sup>o</sup>, 
<i>A</i> and <i>A</i>' are not
mirror points. Consequently, neither <i>B</i>, nor <i>I</i>, nor <i>L</i> 
then are invariants
of motion, and, although it has become common usage, it is not appropriate to
map <i>J</i> or <i>j</i>, measured by a
directional detector, in (<i>B</i>,<i>L</i>) coordinates.
                      
<p>

The mirror point <i>M</i> of a particle with pitch angle 
<i>alpha</i> not equal to 90<sup>o</sup>,
measured at <i>A</i>, does not coincide with <i>A</i>. The magnetic field 
intensity <i>B</i><sub>m</sub>
at <i>M</i> is given by

<center>
<img src="faq08b.gif">
</center>

The adiabatic invariant <i>I</i> is then obtained by substituting <i>A</i> 
and <i>A</i>' by
<i>M</i> and <i>M</i>' in the first equation. <i>L</i><sub>m</sub> is 
obtained from (<i>B</i><sub>m</sub>,<i>I</i>) using
McIlwain's (1961) or Hilton's (1971) algorithm. The coordinates 
(<i>B</i><sub>m</sub>,<i>L</i><sub>m</sub>)
calculated in this way label the drift shell of particles measured at 
<i>A</i> with
pitch angle <i>alpha</i>. [...]

<p>

Particles measured at <i>A</i> with different pitch angles will move 
on different
drift shells, which are uniquely defined by 
(<i>B</i><sub>m</sub>,<i>L</i><sub>m</sub>) (see Figure 2 below).
This phenomenon is usually called - erroneously -``drift shell splitting''.
This term is misleading since it suggests that a particle is forced onto
different drift shells during its longitudinal drift motion, which is not the
case. In fact, a given particle always remains on the same drift shell (which
is not the same as a magnetic shell!), for any magnetic field configuration in
which adiabatic conditions are maintained. Magnetic shells may split, but not
drift shells. The dependence on longitude of the radial extent of a drift shell
in a non-dipole field causes the well-established effect that a particle's
equatorial radial distance changes with local time. Therefore, as was
emphasized by McIlwain (1966), <i>L</i><sub>m</sub> should not be identified 
with a fixed
distance, but should merely be considered as a label to identify drift shells.
Since <i>L</i><sub>m</sub> is not constant along a field line in 
a non-dipole magnetic field,
it is incorrect to label magnetic field lines with McIlwain's 
<i>L</i><sub>m</sub>. The proper
way to identify a field line is with (<i>B</i><sub>eq</sub>,
<i>phi</i><sub>eq</sub>), where
<i>phi</i><sub>eq</sub> is the longitude of the point where the field line
intersects the magnetic equator.

<P>

Instead of (<i>B</i><sub>m</sub>,<i>L</i><sub>m</sub>), the coordinate pair
(<i>alpha</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>L</i><sub>m</sub>) may be used, where
<i>alpha</i><sub>0</sub> is the equatorial pitch angle determined as

<center>
<img src="faq08c.gif">
</center>

where <i>B</i><sub>0</sub> is defined as


<i>B</i><sub>0</sub> = 0.311653  <i>L</i><sub>m</sub><sup>-3</sup>


and 0.311653 is the value of the geomagnetic moment implemented in McIlwain's
software. This expression for <i>B</i><sub>0</sub> was used in the building 
of NASA's trapped
radiation models (Sawyer and Vette 1976, p.8; Singley and Vette 1972, p.
10).
